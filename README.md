## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Dolphin was intended to solve the issue of sending money to your peers when you don't have data available or a wifi connection. The transaction are sent over sound and revieved on the peers device and processed later once connected to the internet. Dolphin uses an API created by [Authorize.net](https://www.authorize.net/) in order to achieve a snadbox environment for money tranfers. Dolphin was awarded best API use at Hack Western 5.
